# My Practice Website

This is a learning project created entirely by me for practicing and enhancing web development skills. The site was built according to a design mockup using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, with Splide used for creating a slider. It is hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Technologies
- HTML – site structure.
- CSS – styling of the page.
- Bootstrap – using ready-made components to simplify the layout.
- Splide – slider for carousels and content.
- Git – version control and collaboration.
- GitHub Pages – hosting for the site.

## Accessibility
The site is available at: https://anticore0.github.io/professional-portfolio-site/
